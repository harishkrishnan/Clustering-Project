Clustering
========================================================

Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense or another) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters). It is a main task of exploratory data mining, and a common technique for statistical data analysis, used in many fields, including machine learning, pattern recognition, image analysis, information retrieval, and bioinformatics
                                            
- Hierarchical clustering is a widely used data analysis tool
- The idea is to build a binary tree of the data that successively
merges similar groups of points
- Visualizing this tree provides a useful summary of the data

Demonstration
========================================================
For this app, I have used the iris data set(first 50 observations only, for the sake of clarity). The clustering is done by calculating the distances between the pair of attributes that the user chooses and clustering them based on their distances from each other.



```r
    hclusters <- reactive({
    distance <- dist(selectedData(),method="euclidean")
    hclust(distance, method = "ward.D")
```

Using the App
========================================================
Please follow the following steps to use the app.

- Choose the attributes that you want to base your clustering upon (don't select Species since it is a non-numeric variable) for the X and Y axes
- Select the number of clusters you want to divide the data set into
- Once you have done this, the Dendrogram shows the split and the table below shows the number of obervations per cluster

Conclusion
========================================================
Trust this app demonstrates the concept of heirarchical clustering in a clear and illustrative manner. This can be used in a wide variety of problems like

  - Classification
  - Regression
  - Recommender Systems 
  
Clustering a data set before building predictive modeling improves the accuracy of the model.
